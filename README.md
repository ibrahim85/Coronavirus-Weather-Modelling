# Modeling the effect of weather on COVID-19 spread
This repo contains the codebase for studying the effect of temperature and humidity on COVID-19 spread.

## Tasks
+ [X] Collect COVID-19 cases' time series for different regions/countries
+ [X] Train a SEIR model to fit the data in the initial stages and correctly predict future data (a couple of days)
+ [X] Collect temperature and humidity data for the period the model is trained and tested on
+ [X] Plot the trends --> observe the model parameters as function of temperature and humidity
+ [ ] Use the weather forecast to predict COVID-19 cases by simulating a SEIR model with appropriate parameters
